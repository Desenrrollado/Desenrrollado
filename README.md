Hi I'm Desenrrollado, but you can see that I think? Unless my username isn't showing up.

I'm currently on Github to follow/explore a variety of different software, plugins, forks, mods, and even optimizations.

I unfortunately don't code and lack the proper experience. Most of what little Python I learned is gone. 

I would love to be able to make Minecraft mods one day or rom hacks for Smw one day.

As well as love to be able to help out or collaborate with plenty of people. 

I'm able to test programs or games for issues/bugs. Currently on a 64-bit version of Windows 11. So if there's anything I can do feel free to ask. Especially if you make dope indie games.
