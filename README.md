Hi I'm Desenrrollado

I'm currently on Github to follow a variety of different software, plugins, forks, mods, and even optimizations.
I unforunately don't code or know too much on that side. What little Python I tried to learn years ago is long gone.
I definitely would love to be able to make minecrat mods or learn to code in general. Though it's been kind of on the back burner...

I'd love to be able to help out or collaborate with plenty of people. Though I'm not able to do much at the moment besides test programs on the windows side of things. If there's anything I can do to assist please feel free to ask.
