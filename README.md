Hi I'm Desenrrollado. (Des-en-roll-ado or Dezen-roe-yahh-doe) Shorten it to Des if that makes it easy. 

Currently I'm on here to occastionally follow and snoop through various things that catch my eye. Be it cool software, plugins, mods, optimizations, forks, you name it. As long as it's cool and catches my eye. I'll be following it.

No I don't code. It's maybe a result of it being pushed on me too much from a young age. I've tried multiple times even with what little Python I did. It just isn't for me. Just flew out the window. I think it's cool and neat that others can do it. Major props to you all. 

That being said. I would love to make a proper indepth full feature length Smw hack or port/make a mod for Mc. Though those would be on my own time for fun and outta passion. Maybe one day huh?

I'd love to collaborate with plenty of people if possible. So if you have an indie game or mod. Please feel free to ask I'd love to test it on my machine. That or if I can help feel free to ask. I run a 64 bit version of Windows 11. So keep that in mind. 

If you have any forks or other cool software likewise. Send em my way and I'll toss em on my lists. Maybe you'll find something you like. 

With that said. Thanks for reading this. Sorry to keep yah. Have a good rest of your morning, afternoon, evening or night.
